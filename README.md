<b> React Form App</b> </br>
This project consists of a form divided into 3 steps:

Step 1: Users are required to input their name, surname, and optionally their date of birth. I perform checks on the characters of the name and surname, as well as the validity of the date of birth.

Step 2: Users are prompted to input their email and password. Here, I validate that the password is in the correct format.

Step 3: Users select their favorite flower from a mock list.

I use mock promises to validate the fields; incorrect entries prevent users from proceeding. The form is responsive and adjusts to fit the screen, becoming a slider on mobile devices. Upon completion of the form, users land on a welcome page with a summary of the information provided.
