# React Form App
This project consists of a form divided into 3 steps:

### Step 1:
Users are prompted to enter their name, surname, and optionally their date of birth. I've implemented character checks for the name and surname fields, as well as validation for the date of birth.
### Step 2: 
In this step, users are asked to provide their email address and choose a password. Password validation ensures that users enter passwords in the correct format.

### Step 3: 
Users are presented with a selection of mock flowers to choose their favorite from.

The form is designed to be responsive and adjusts seamlessly to fit various screen sizes, with a mobile-friendly slider layout for smaller devices.

I've customized the theme of Material-UI and integrated Tailwind CSS classes for styling, creating a visually appealing and consistent user interface.

You can test the application yourself <a href="https://stackblitz.com/~/github.com/agneseMarchionneschi/react-form-app">here<a/>.
